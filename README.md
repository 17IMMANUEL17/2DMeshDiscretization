# 2DMeshDiscretization
In this project we aim to provide a library to discretize in a conforming way 2D convex domains. The application can be used both in C++ and Python (although the C++ part extends the Python one that only haves the main methods applied for the discretization) .
The only external library used is `eigen` in th C++ part and `numpy` in the Python part.

Then we provide the UML of the C++ application:
